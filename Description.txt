At its core, DevAlert is a remote job search platform but it is actually much more than that. It does everything you'd expect from your fully-fledged remote job platform and more. We created DevAlert with the intention of designing it to be a easy way to get remote job opportunities for free to ease the stress of applying for jobs by connecting you with credible and reliable agents who are ready to help you apply for jobs for a small fee.

THE PROBLEM ‚ùì
Existing Remote Job search platforms, lack essential features such as targeted notifications, credible vacancies being posted or charge a lot of money and may sometimes even present you with incapable hands. After dealing with this problem ourselves for years, we decided it was time for someone to step in and pick up from where the others dropped the ball.

THE SOLUTION ‚úÖ
We built Devalert. A Fully fledged Remote Job Search Platform that has everything you need to get your hustle as a remote job searching developer up and running- with new features released on a fast development timeline and support that you can actually rely on.

Devalert already goes above and beyond other top rated Job Search Platforms- most of which charge a lot of money, are loaded with annoying conditions and bloated features. 

THE ROADMAP üéØ
We have been and continue to work day and night to perfect and improve DevAlert so you'll be pleased to hear we have some exciting new features lined up that will be rolling out in the months and weeks to come.
